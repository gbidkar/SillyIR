## Overview

SillyIR is a private fork of the great [SmartIR](https://github.com/smartHomeHub/SmartIR) integration, with personal
customizations and fixes. It is not intended for public use, but feel free to use it if you want.

The focus is primarily for Broadlink-based IR devices, since this is what I have and what I'm testing the code with.

### Differences
